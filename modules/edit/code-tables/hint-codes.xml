                <p> Type identifies what type of Title Information is recorded, if this information is special. If the title is recorded as it appears on the title page, it does not have Type. Use Type if the title is abbreviated, translated, alternative, or uniform (a transliteration is here regarded as a form of translation). </p>
                <p> When an abbreviated title is present, an Authority must be chosen. An alternative title may be a parallel title found in the authoritative title information (in written works, typically the title page) or a title that does not occur in the authoritative title information, e.g. a title found on a cover. If the alternative title does not occur in the authoritative title information, indicate in Display Label where the information comes from (e.g., "Cover Title"). If the alternative title occurs in the authoritative title information, it can e.g. be a translation or a transliteration of the main title information. If a translated or a transliterated title occurs in the authoritative title information of the work being catalogued, choose "Alternative" for Type and note the language, transliteration and script of the title information, as appropriate, if this is different from the language noted in Language of Resource. If this is not the case and you have e.g. supplied the translation or transliteration yourself, choose "Translated" for Type and note the language, transliteration and script of the title information, as appropriate. </p>
                <p> A uniform title is a title that refers uniformly to a work that is known by several titles, e.g. the works of Shakespeare or the Bible. When a uniform title is present, an Authority for its selection must be chosen. </p>

                <p> At least one Title inside a Title Information is required. Title Information can be repeated for alternative, translated, transliterated or
                    uniform titles. These values are chosen in Type. For the basic Title Information entry, leave Type blank or use the value "Basic Title
                    Information". If, in addition to the basic title, you also wish to record an alternative, translated, transliterated or uniform title, add a
                    Title Information and choose the relevant Type. Repeat Title Information as many times as necessary. </p>
                <p> A Title Information consists of a main Title, plus a number of supplementary fields that relate to it. A Title may have a Subtitle, usually
                    an expansion of the Title proper. If the Title begins with a word according to which it should not be sorted (such as "The" or "A" and the
                    like), enter this word in Non Sort and remove it from Title. If a publication consists of several parts, parts that are either numbered or
                    named, use Part Number and/or Part Name. "A History of Philosophy" may have several numbered parts, such as "Part One. Ancient Greek
                    Philosophy." Enter "Part One" in Part Number and "Ancient Greek Philosophy" in Part Name. </p>

                    concisely as possible, the content of the resource in question. If no standards apply, consider carefully the expectations users have for
                    the naming of similar resources. </p>
                <p> If an alternative, translated or transliterated title is recorded, choose the relevant Type for each separate Title Information. </p>
